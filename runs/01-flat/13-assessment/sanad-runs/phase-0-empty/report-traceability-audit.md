## Configuration identity and completeness

**Mode:** Engineering — generated on a workstation, outside the certification recipe; this report carries no certification credit.

**Generated from commit:** `46913ef7a2ef306336786482c8732e256ca2a410`

**Tool version:** `sanad 0.6.3`

**Inputs:** `0 requirements`

This report regenerates byte-identically from the same commit with the same tool version and inputs — it names no clock and reads nothing outside those inputs, so any second run that differs is evidence something changed, not that the report drifted.

**Rule pack:** `requirements-writing`

**Analyses that ran:** `validation`, `traceability`, `quality`, `structure`, `verification`, `consistency`, `impact`

**Analyses that did not run:**

- `architecture` — did not run: no template in this repository declares the role `allocation`. It produced no findings, and that silence is not a clean result.
- `conformance` — did not run: no template in this repository declares the role `allocation`. It produced no findings, and that silence is not a clean result.
- `implementation` — did not run: no template in this repository declares the role `implements`. It produced no findings, and that silence is not a clean result.
- `interface` — did not run: no template in this repository declares the role `interface`. It produced no findings, and that silence is not a clean result.
- `safety` — did not run: no template in this repository declares the role `hazard`. It produced no findings, and that silence is not a clean result.
- `security` — did not run: no template in this repository declares the role `threat`. It produced no findings, and that silence is not a clean result.

**Criticality levels present:** none declared

## Trace legs required by criticality band

The resolved band decides which trace legs are *mandatory*; a leg a band does not require is shown as one that did not run, never dropped (rule 4). Policy is resolved once at load — this table renders that result, it does not compute it (rule 11).

| Band (rigour) | Native level(s) | Requirements | Mandatory legs | Did not run at this level |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Level trace matrices

**Objective:** DO-178C Table A-3 objective 6, *high-level requirements are traceable to system requirements*, and the same objective at each level below it; evidenced by the trace data of §5.5, *the bi-directional association between* requirements at adjacent levels.

No requirement traces up to another, so there are no level pairs to matrix. Every requirement that should trace up but does not is listed under Orphans below.

## Derived requirements

**Objective:** DO-178C Table A-2 objectives 2 and 5, *derived requirements are defined and provided to the system processes, including the system safety assessment process* (§5.1.2).

Every requirement this repository marks derived, with the argument for it. A derived requirement is one no higher-level requirement demands, so nothing above it justifies it: each has to be identified, and the argument for it has to reach the system processes — the system safety assessment among them. Those are this table's last two columns. The justification is the requirement's own recorded rationale, printed verbatim — where none is recorded the row says so and names the finding, and the report does not argue the exemption for the author (rule 4).

**Count:** 0

No requirement in this repository is marked derived.

## Traceability deficiencies

**Objective:** DO-178C §11.17, a problem report records *deficiencies in software life cycle data* — here the trace data of §5.5, read against Table A-3 objective 6.

Every traceability defect the analysis raised over this commit, one row each: the kind of defect, the requirement it is about, the other end of the link where the defect names one, the level that requirement belongs to, the severity THIS repository staged for that kind, and the finding in the words the engineer sees. Nothing here is recomputed for the report — these are the findings themselves, so the table and the editor cannot disagree (rule 4).

**Count:** 0

None found.

## Declared gaps

Every gap class below is present even when empty — "no gaps" is a count of zero, never a missing section (rule 4).

### Orphans — requirements tracing up to nothing

**Count:** 0

No orphans.

### Childless — an approved requirement nothing traces up to

Where the repository declares a hierarchy, an approved requirement with no child is a gap in downward trace.

**Count:** 0

No childless approved requirements.

### Unverified — requirements with no verifying case

Not reported — this repository declares no verification vocabulary (`verifies`, `method` or `disposition`) and no producer declared a verification case, so verification coverage does not run rather than reporting every requirement as unverified (rule 4).

### Derived / exempted — requirements a declaration waived from the orphan rule

**Count:** 0

No derived exemptions.
